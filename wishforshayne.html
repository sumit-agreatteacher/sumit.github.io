    <h2>Happy Birthday, Shark Boss!</h2>

    <p>
      It still feels strange that the person I used to argue science with over long
      evening walks or lunch or on the way back home is now the one shaping young minds
      from the other side of the lecture hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      In just over a year as a professor, you have already made the role look natural—
      because I think you never treated physics as a subject to “cover,” but as a way
      to think clearly, doubt honestly, and learn deeply.
    </p>

    <p>
      I miss our scientific discussions—the kind where curiosity led, where ideas were
      tested without ego, where the joy was in the reasoning as much as in the result.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have that rock-solid steadiness—quiet confidence, strong values, and a
      presence that makes people feel supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      May this year bring you new questions worth chasing, results that make you proud,
      students who challenge you in the best ways, and the kind of peace that comes
      from doing meaningful work with integrity.
    </p>
